# Herugrim - Discord OIDC Provider for Cloudflare Access

A Discord OIDC provider for Cloudflare Access, based on [Erisa/discord-oidc-worker](https://github.com/Erisa/discord-oidc-worker). Herugrim is developed and maintained by [@quietarcade](https://github.com/quietarcade) as part of [Meduseld](https://github.com/meduseld-io). Rebuilt with environment-based configuration, role-based admin detection, and richer user profile claims.

Allows you to authenticate with Cloudflare Access using your Discord account via a Cloudflare Worker. Wraps OIDC around the Discord OAuth2 API.

## What Changed from the Original

### `worker.js`

- **Environment-based configuration** - all config reads from Wrangler environment variables (`env.CLIENT_ID`, `env.CLIENT_SECRET`, etc.) instead of hardcoded constants. Secrets stay out of source code.
- **Removed KV dependency** - the signing key comes from the `SIGNING_KEY` Wrangler secret instead of Cloudflare KV. Tokens carry a `kid` matching the JWKS entry.
- **Migrated to Hono** - replaced the raw `addEventListener("fetch")` handler with [Hono](https://hono.dev/) for cleaner routing.
- **Added `discord_user` claim to ID token** - the JWT includes a `discord_user` object with: `id`, `username`, `global_name`, `avatar`, `discriminator`, and `is_admin`.
- **Added optional admin role detection** - when `ADMIN_ROLE_ID` is set, the worker checks guild membership for that role and sets `is_admin` accordingly. `ADMIN_GUILD_ID` defaults to `ALLOWED_GUILDS[0]` if not set separately.
- **Dynamic OAuth scopes** - only requests `guilds.members.read` when admin detection is enabled, reducing permissions for simpler setups.
- **Added error handling** - Discord API responses are validated with descriptive error messages on failure.
- **Added `/health` endpoint** - returns `{ "status": "ok" }` for uptime monitoring.
- **Added guild restriction** - users must be a member of an allowed guild to authenticate (optional).
- **Verified emails only** - users whose Discord email is unverified are rejected, so Access email rules can be trusted.

### `wrangler.toml`

- **Removed KV namespace binding** - only `name`, `main`, `compatibility_date`, and `[vars]` template remain.

### `package.json`

- **Simplified** - only `hono` and `jose` at runtime. Scripts for `dev`, `deploy`, `check`, `generate-key`, and releases.

### Removed from Original

- `config.json` / `config.sample.json` - configuration is via environment variables
- KV namespace requirement

## Setup

Requirements:

- A Cloudflare account with Workers enabled
- A Cloudflare Access account with a `<name>.cloudflareaccess.com` subdomain
- A [Discord developer application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with OAuth2 configured
  - Redirect URI: `https://<name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback`
- Node.js installed

### Quick Deploy

Click the deploy button above, or manually:

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meduseld-io/herugrim.git
   cd herugrim
   npm install
   ```

2. Set your environment variables in `wrangler.toml`:
   ```toml
   [vars]
   CLIENT_ID = "your-discord-app-id"
   REDIRECT_URI = "https://yourname.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback"

   # Optional - restrict to specific Discord servers (comma-separated)
   ALLOWED_GUILDS = "guild-id-1,guild-id-2"

   # Optional - detect admin role
   ADMIN_GUILD_ID = ""
   ADMIN_ROLE_ID = ""
   ```

3. Set your client secret and a signing key as Wrangler secrets (keeps them out of source):
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put CLIENT_SECRET
   npm run generate-key | npx wrangler secret put SIGNING_KEY
   ```
   Generate the signing key once and keep it. Without it, each worker instance makes its own temporary key, which changes on every deploy and can make logins fail at random.

4. Test locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CLIENT_ID` | Yes | Discord application OAuth2 client ID |
| `CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | Discord application OAuth2 client secret (use `wrangler secret put`) |
| `REDIRECT_URI` | Yes | `https://<name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback` |
| `ALLOWED_GUILDS` | No | Comma-separated guild IDs to restrict access. Empty = allow any Discord user |
| `ADMIN_GUILD_ID` | No | Guild to check for admin role. Defaults to first `ALLOWED_GUILDS` entry |
| `ADMIN_ROLE_ID` | No | Discord role ID that grants admin. Empty = skip admin detection |
| `SIGNING_KEY` | Recommended | Private RSA JWK used to sign ID tokens (use `wrangler secret put`, generate with `npm run generate-key`) |

## Endpoints

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Health check - returns `{ "status": "ok" }` |
| `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration` | OIDC discovery document |
| `GET /authorize` | Redirects to Discord OAuth2 consent screen |
| `POST /token` | Exchanges authorization code for tokens |
| `GET /jwks.json` | JSON Web Key Set for token verification |

## Cloudflare Access Configuration

1. Go to [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) → Settings → Authentication
2. Add a new OpenID Connect login method:
   - **App ID**: Your Discord application ID
   - **Client secret**: Your Discord OAuth2 secret
   - **Auth URL**: `https://herugrim-discord-oidc.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/authorize`
   - **Token URL**: `https://herugrim-discord-oidc.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/token`
   - **Certificate URL**: `https://herugrim-discord-oidc.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/jwks.json`
   - **PKCE**: Disabled (the worker does not implement PKCE, so enabling it adds no protection)
   - **OIDC Claims**: `id`, `preferred_username`, `name`, `discord_user`

The `discord_user` claim appears under the `custom` key in the Cloudflare Access identity response and contains `id`, `username`, `global_name`, `avatar`, `discriminator`, and `is_admin`.
